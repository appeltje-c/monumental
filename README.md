## Intro

This project is my implementation of the Monumental "Visualizing a Robotic Crane" technical assessment.

The project consists of an API, React Application and the Blender crane model in the folders:

* api - A NodeJS project displaying backend technology using MongoDB and Websocket connectivity
* model - The Mesh and armature of the Crane modelled in Blender
* ops - A React Application visualizing the Crane displaying frontend technology using React Three Fiber and the API
  over Websockets for the telemetry data.

## Running the project

The project has been configured to run with Docker. It is possible to run without Docker but requires extra steps to
install MongoDB, seed the data and configure the network. For the sake of brevity this has been left out of the cope of 
the assessment. Drop me a message if you want to run it without Docker.

Running the project takes a few steps:

* Make sure Docker is installed running: [https://www.docker.com/get-started/](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
* Clone the repo and run docker

```shell
git clone https://github.com/appeltje-c/monumental
cd monumental
docker compose up -d
```

When the Docker output reads

<img src="./docs/docker.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

the project is running and you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

To stop the containers

```shell
docker compose down
```

## What's in the box

There are three main projects

[Monumental Ops](./ops/README.md) : The React App

[Monumental API](./api/README.md) : The API

[Monumental Model](./model/README.md) : The Crane Model

Enjoy!

Here is a collection of online resources I used to get familiar with 3D in the browser and Robotics in general.

Todo:

1. Websockets
2. config property from .env
3. Setup viewport with websockets and simple model
4. Seed Mongo Data
